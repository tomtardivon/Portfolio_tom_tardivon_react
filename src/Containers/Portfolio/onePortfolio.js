                                <li>Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for. </li>
                                <li>The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog. </li>
                                <li>It's possible to work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of
                                    <a href="https://ghost.org/integrations/">integrations</a> to speed up your workflows, connect email lists, build communities and much more.</li>

                            <p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our
                                <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing">Ghost(Pro)</a> service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.
                            </p>
                            <p>The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source
                                <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost">community</a>.

                            <h2 id="next-up-the-editor">Next up, the editor</h2><p>The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: <a href="https://gatsby.ghost.io/the-editor/">the Ghost editor</a>. This is where the good stuff happens.</p>
